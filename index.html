      <h2 class="card-title">Creative</h2>
      <p>Creative photography is a technique by which you combine different shapes, colors, and forms of 
        ordinary moments and turn them into creative art using your photography skills. 
        This type of photography demands a unique way of seeing things and projecting an innovative image, altered from reality.</p>
